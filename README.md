# handoff-notes
Handoff Notes is an offline-first Flutter app to manage follow-ups you’re waiting on others for—approvals, vendor replies, reviews—and generate clean handover / standup updates in one tap. Built with local SQLite, smart “last ping → next ping” reminders, templates, and copy-to-clipboard outputs.
